# Benchmarking
## Background
With machine learning methods we can generate computer programs to solve problems which are too complex to write manually.  Machine learning has several advantages including fast, adaptable, self-correcting and unbiased. 

## Target
Different dataset and prediction need different models. In this research, our goal is to automatically find the best models for the dataset. We can find out the most appropriate model for each dataset and prediction. Finally, we can lower barrier for using the machine learning in material science. 

## Conclusion:

1. It is necessary to do the research about how to find the best model for the dataset and prediction.    
	a. The property we want to predict has some influence on the performances of the model.   
	b. Dataset can influence performances of models.
  
2. In the future work, we should focus on the performance of rotation forest and random subspace.   
 	a. Among the four models, rotation forest and random subspace always have the best performances.
  
3. We can build a tool which can automatically find the best model for dataset to lower the barrier for using the machine learning in material science. 

## Future Work

**Improve the existing work**
1. Find out how the size of the dataset influences the performance of the model.   

2. Find out how the property influences the performance of the model.   

3. Compare the performances with other people’s work.   

**What to do next**
1. Do tests on more dataset with more models.
